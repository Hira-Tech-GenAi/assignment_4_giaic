# 📊 Data Analytics App by Hira Khalid 🚀

This project builds a *data analytics* web application in 15 minutes using *Streamlit*, a Python library for interactive web apps. The app displays a product dataset, allows price-based filtering, and shows a sales trend chart. It is designed for simplicity and ease of use 😊.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

* Install *Python* 🐍: Ensure Python version 3.7 or higher is installed.
* Install Dependencies 📦: Run the following command to install required libraries:


## 🌐 Access the App

* Open the URL in your browser (typically `http://localhost:8501`).
* View the dataset, adjust the price filter using the slider, and observe the updated chart to explore sales trends 📈.

## 📝 Code Explanation

The `app.py` script includes the following components:

* *Imports* 📚: Streamlit for the web interface, Pandas for data handling, and NumPy for numerical operations.
* *Page Title* 🏷️: Sets the application title with a chart emoji.
* *Sample Dataset* 📋: Creates a Pandas DataFrame with product data, including Product, Price, and Sales.
* *Data Display* 📄: Shows the dataset using Streamlit's dataframe function.
* *Price Filter* 🔍: Provides a slider to filter products by maximum price, updating the displayed data.
* *Line Chart* 📉: Renders a line chart of sales data for the filtered products.
* *Footer* ✍️: Includes attribution to the author with a heart emoji.

## 🎉 Features

* *Interactive Interface* 🖱️: Filter data dynamically with a price slider.
* *Visualization* 📊: Displays a line chart of sales data.
* *Simple Design* ✨: Clear and organized layout for user-friendly navigation.
* *Fast Setup* ⏱️: Build and deploy in under 15 minutes.

## 🚀 Usage

* Launch the app with the command:

* In the browser, view the complete dataset 🖥️.
* Use the price slider to filter products by maximum price 🔎.
* Check the updated sales chart based on the filtered data 📉.

## 📌 Notes

* Streamlit supports Markdown for text formatting. See [Streamlit Docs](https://docs.streamlit.io) for more information 📖.
* The app uses a static dataset for simplicity. You can replace it with a CSV file using Pandas' `read_csv` function 📂.
* For additional features, explore Streamlit's widgets, such as `selectbox` or `button` 🛠️.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
